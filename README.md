'wordwide' is an English pronunciation app that allows English language learners to search for any English word and uses the phonetic spelling of that word to search for and return other English words that contain the same sound clusters. The goal of this is that the language learner will learn new vocabulary and pronunciations through reinforcement learning based on drawing from their current vocabulary and pronunciation knowledge.
